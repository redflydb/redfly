# Sequence Coordinates

Sequence coordinates for _Drosophila melanogaster_ default to the most current release, Release 6 (dm6, Aug. 2014). Coordinates from release 5 are available through the dropdown at the top of the “[basic info](detailed-view-window.md#basic-info)” tab and as options for [download](downloads.md#downloads). Although we maintain the R3 and R4 coordinates for older records, they will no longer be available for download. If you require R3 or R4 coordinates please [contact us](http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu/contact.php).

Sequence coordinates are represented in _**RED**fly_ as one-based start, one-based end (for a discussion of genome coordinate representations, see [here](http://genome.ucsc.edu/FAQ/FAQtracks.html) and [here](http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Coordinate_Transforms)).
