# Introduction

_**RED**fly_ is a curated collection of known insect transcriptional _cis_-regulatory modules (CRMs) and transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs). Our mission is to extract, accumulate, organize, annotate, and link the growing body of information on insect transcriptional _cis_-regulatory sequences, with an emphasis on empirically validated CRMs curated from the published literature. The majority of the data are for _Drosophila melanogaster_, but we also annotate an increasing number of other insects.

_**RED**fly_ seeks to include all experimentally verified insect regulatory elements along with their DNA sequence, their associated genes, and the expression patterns they direct. Expression patterns are annotated using defined anatomy ontologies to enable high interoperability with insect genome databases, especially FlyBase and other model organism resources.
