# Versioning and Updated Records

Prior to v5.0, _**RED**fly_ incremented its version number only with the release of major new features—version numbers did not increase with addition or update of new records. To properly reflect the content of _**RED**fly_ at any given time, please use the date of access as well as the version number.

Starting with v5.0, _**RED**fly_ moved from a continuous-release to a versioned-release cycle. From v5.0 forward, new records are only added/updated in conjunction with a numbered release.

_**RED**fly_ tracks updates/corrections to individual records. The date of the last update to a record can be found in the “[basic info](detailed-view-window.md#basic-info)” pane of the [detailed view window](detailed-view-window.md#detailed-view-window) and the number of times a record has been updated is recorded by the value of the third segment of the _**RED**fly_ ID (e.g., RFRC:00000272.001 indicates the first entry of the record, RFRC:00000272.002 the second, etc.). To obtain data for pervious versions of a specific record, please [contact us](http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu/contact.php).
